# THE LITTLE LEMON RESTAURANT

## Description
This is the Capstone Project in Front-end Development Courses from Coursera. Build a website **The Little Lemon**.
Through this project, I learned:
1. The introduction to OOP in Python:
    - class, object.
    - class attribute/method vs instance attribute/method.
    - static method.
    - "all" attribute (a class attribute to store all the objects belonging to that class)
    - property: read-only attribute.
2. The basis of Tkinter library for making UI in Python.
3. A little of **osascript** to prompt the dialog box.
